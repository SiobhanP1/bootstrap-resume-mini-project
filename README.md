# Resume Website

## Purpose

This website is based on the Resume Walkthrough Project provided by Code Institute, with minor changes. My goal in building it was to become familiar with Bootstrap, before moving on to building my own projects using Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been used in combination with other CSS in order to create a site that looks original. 

The purpose of the Resume website is to:
* clearly communicate skills and job history.
* provide multiple methods of contact.
* showcase personality and skill through the website itself. 
* provide an option to download the individual's CV.
* provide links to the individual's social media and Github pages. 

The website is targeted at potential employers and recruiters, as well as fellow developers who would like to collaborate on a project. 

### Project Status

This project is as yet incomplete. Some bugs remain and there is still information that is missing in places on the site and in this README document. 

## User Stories 

* As a recruiter or employer, I want to know what makes this individual special so I can decide whether they are a good fit for my company.
* As a recruiter, I want to know this individual's work history and skills so that I know whether they might be suitably qualified and skilled for a job. 
* As a visiting developer, I want to know how to send a proposal so that we can build together.
* As a recruiter or employer, I want to know how to contact this individual so that I can schedule an interview or get more information.
* As a recruiter or employer, I want to know where to download their CV so that I share their information with others I work with.  

## Features
